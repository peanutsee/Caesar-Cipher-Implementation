# Caesar Cipher
Caesar Cipher is a cryptographic method developed and used by Julius Caesar to communicate with his private correspondence during his reign. Today, the Caesar Cipher may seem too trival (easily decrypted) but back in the days, it was almost impossible to decrypt the encrypted messages. The mathematical concept used in this implementation is Integer Modulo n. 

# Integer Modulo n
Definition: a â‰¡ bmodn <-> a = qn + b 
This concept is built atop of the concept of Eucliean Division.

# Implementation 
In this implementation, I created a CaesarCipher() class with 3 methods; encrypt, decrypt and get_key.
